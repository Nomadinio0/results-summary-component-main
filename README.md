## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

I have recaped some basics of HTML and CSS by doing this challenge. Learned to add svg icons properly, had some issues with aligning them to the text in paragraphs.

### Continued development

In upcoming projects I will definately start by doing mobile version first. I haven't done it here and lost too much time fixing the code.
